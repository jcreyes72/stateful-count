# stateful-count 🔢
This app displays an increment and decrement button, plus a value that gets updated accordingly. It stores the state of the count in our database so that it never resets. I thought that this project would be a great introduction into learning about ReactJS as well as Full Stack Development

# deployment 👨‍💻
I used Render.com to deploy this site, you can check it out here: https://statefulcount-front.onrender.com/ (Constraints below)

# constraints 🚫
I'm having issues getting this site to work on mobile, as well as with Safari. So Chrome and Firefox are the recommended browsers until I can get 
those bugs fixed
