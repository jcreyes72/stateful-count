# stateful-count 🔢
This application features increment and decrement buttons, along with a value that is updated accordingly. The state of the count is stored in our database to ensure that it is never reset. I thought that this project would serve as a useful introduction to both ReactJS and full stack development.

# deployment 👨‍💻
I used Render.com to deploy this site, you can check it out here: https://statefulcount-front.onrender.com/ (Constraints below)

# constraints 🚫
The website I used to deploy this site can be a little unreliable at times. The counter may take a second or two to load, and might require a couple of refreshes. I am currently working to fix these issues.
